### 1.1. Obtain the Access Token

1. **Create or Log In to Hugging Face**  
   - If you don't already have an account, sign up at [huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join).

2. **Request Model Access**  
   - Go to the [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 page](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) and request access if itâ€™s required.

3. **Generate a Token**

### 1.2. Add the Token to the `.env` File

1. **Locate Your `.env`**  
   - This file can be found in the `backend` folder or wherever you keep your environment variables.

2. **Insert the Token**  
   - Open `.env` in your favorite text editor.  
   - Add the following line (or update it if it already exists), making sure to replace `insert_token_here` with your actual Hugging Face token:

     ```bash
     HUGGING_FACE_ACCESS_TOKEN=insert_token_here
     ```

3. **Save and Close**  
   - Save your changes to `.env`.  
   - Your application will now have the necessary credentials to access and interact with Hugging Face models.
